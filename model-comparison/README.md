# Model Comparison
In the main document an evaluation of the different models is given where their goodness of fit is determined and predction accuracy is measured with respect to the *VQEG* and *KonIQ-10k* dataset.
Here, we provide a visual comparison of the models and give more details on how they compare to each other.
